Receiver stores data frame in buffer, performs processing; buffer may become fullProblem assumes no transmission errors and small propagation timeSolutions: Stop-and-wait mechanism, sliding window mechanismStop-and-Wait (Flow Control)Principles: transmitter sends single frame, waits for ACK from receiver before sending next frameDiagram of stop-and-waitStop-and-Wait (Advantages and Weaknesses)Advantages: simple, suitable for large framesWeaknesses: inefficient for small frames, not suitable for very large frames (buffer limitations, error probability), inconvenient for shared mediumSliding Window: PrincipleTransmitter sends multiple frames without waiting for ACK to reduce waiting timeTransmitted frames without ACK are stored in bufferNumber of frames sent without ACK depends on transmitter buffer sizeTransmitter removes successfully transmitted frames from buffers upon receiving ACKTransmitter continues sending frames based on number of successfully transmitted framesSliding Window: AcknowledgementFrame numbering is necessary to track ACKed framesReceiver acknowledges a frame by indicating the next expected frame, implicitly acknowledging all preceding framesOne ACK can acknowledge multiple framesSliding Windows: PrincipleWindow lists frames to transmit and frames waiting for acknowledgementSliding WindowsFrames are numbered; maximum number must not be smaller than window sizeFrames are ACKed by another message with numberAccumulated ACK:  If frame 1,2,3,4 are received well, receiver acknowledges frame 5.\n"

      "The Datalink layer, positioned between the Network and Physical layers in the network architecture, is responsible for transferring network-layer datagrams between physically adjacent nodes (hosts and routers) across communication links (wired, wireless, LANs). Its primary functions include encapsulating datagrams into frames (Layer 2 packets), link-layer addressing using unique 48-bit MAC addresses assigned by IEEE, flow control to prevent receiver overload, error detection and correction to handle transmission impairments, and Media Access Control (MAC) to coordinate access on shared media. The Datalink layer is typically implemented within a node's Network Interface Card (NIC) using a combination of hardware, software, and firmware, often split into Logical Link Control (LLC, e.g., IEEE 802.2) and MAC (e.g., IEEE 802.3 Ethernet, 802.11 Wi-Fi) sublayers. Error detection techniques include Parity checks, Checksum (using ones' complement sum), and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), a powerful method using polynomial division (modulo 2) widely employed in Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Reliable data transfer over unreliable links is often achieved using Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) protocols like Stop-and-Wait, Go-Back-N, or Selective Reject, which utilize acknowledgements (ACKs), sequence numbers, and timeouts for retransmission. Flow control mechanisms like Stop-and-Wait and the more efficient Sliding Window (which allows multiple outstanding frames up to a window size W, using cumulative ACKs and potentially Piggybacking) regulate data transmission speed. For shared broadcast links, MAC protocols are essential to prevent collisions. These protocols include Channel Partitioning (FDMA, TDMA, CDMA dividing resources), Random Access (ALOHA, CSMA, CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA allowing collisions and recovery), and Taking Turns (Polling, Token Ring ensuring orderly access). CSMA variants involve sensing the carrier; CSMA/CD (Ethernet) adds collision detection during transmission, while CSMA/CA (Wi-Fi) uses collision avoidance strategies like random backoff and optional RTS/CTS exchange. LAN devices operate at different layers: Repeaters/Hubs (Layer 1) simply regenerate signals within a single collision domain, while Bridges/Switches (Layer 2) forward frames based on MAC addresses, segmenting collision domains. Switches learn MAC address-to-port mappings via self-learning and forward frames selectively, flooding only when the destination is unknown. Routers (Layer 3) forward packets based on IP addresses using routing tables, rebuilding Layer 2 frames for each link traversed. Common LAN standards include IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet), which originally used CSMA/CD but now predominantly uses switches eliminating collisions, and IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi), which uses CSMA/CA and operates in infrastructure (via Access Points) or ad-hoc modes. Virtual LANs (VLANs) allow segmenting a physical LAN into multiple logical broadcast domains for better scalability, security, and management, often using port-based configuration or IEEE 802.1q tagging for traffic isolation across trunked switches. Optical access networks (FTTx, e.g., FTTH) use fiber optic cables to connect users, employing Active Optical Networks (AON) with powered nodes or Passive Optical Networks (PON) like EPON and GPON which use passive splitters and typically employ downstream broadcast and upstream Time Division Multiplexing (TDM).\n"
